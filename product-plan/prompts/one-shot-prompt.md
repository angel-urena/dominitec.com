# One-Shot Implementation Prompt

I need you to implement a complete landing page based on detailed design specifications and UI components I'm providing.

## Instructions

Please carefully read and analyze the following files:

1. **@product-plan/product-overview.md** — Product summary with sections and design tokens overview
2. **@product-plan/instructions/one-shot-instructions.md** — Complete implementation instructions for all milestones

After reading these, also review:
- **@product-plan/design-system/** — Color and typography tokens
- **@product-plan/sections/** — All section components, types, sample data, and test instructions

## Before You Begin

Please ask me clarifying questions about:

1. **Tech Stack Preferences**
   - What framework should I use? (Next.js, Vite, Remix, etc.)
   - Any specific hosting/deployment requirements?
   - Should this be a single-page app or multi-page?

2. **Contact Form Backend**
   - How should form submissions be handled?
   - Email service integration? (SendGrid, Mailgun, Resend, etc.)
   - Should submissions be stored in a database?
   - Any CRM integration needed?

3. **Analytics & Tracking**
   - Should I add analytics? (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)
   - Any conversion tracking requirements?

4. **SEO & Meta**
   - What meta descriptions and titles should be used?
   - Any Open Graph images needed?
   - Sitemap and robots.txt requirements?

5. **Any Other Clarifications**
   - Questions about specific features or user flows
   - Additional pages beyond the landing page?
   - Any integrations or third-party services?

Lastly, be sure to ask me if I have any other notes to add for this implementation.

Once I answer your questions, create a comprehensive implementation plan before coding.
