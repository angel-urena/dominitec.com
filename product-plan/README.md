# Dominitec — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement the Dominitec landing page.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt template for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section implementation

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (provide with every implementation)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined for full implementation
- `instructions/incremental/` — Milestone-by-milestone instructions (foundation, then sections)

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, design tokens

**Sections:**
- `sections/hero/` — Hero section components, types, sample data, and test instructions
- `sections/services/` — Services section components, types, sample data, and test instructions
- `sections/contact/` — Contact section components, types, sample data, and test instructions

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your landing page milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`) — project setup, design tokens, routing
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables at the top (SECTION_NAME, SECTION_ID, NN)
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

**Section Order:**
1. Foundation (01) — Project setup
2. Hero (02) — Landing hero section
3. Services (03) — Service cards
4. Contact (04) — Quote request form

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire landing page in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Add any additional notes to the prompt
4. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
5. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
6. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

The test instructions are **framework-agnostic** — they describe WHAT to test, not HOW. Adapt to your testing setup (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, React Testing Library, etc.).

## Section Overview

### Hero
Eye-catching introduction with:
- Headline highlighting value proposition
- Subtext describing services
- "Get a Quote" CTA button
- Tech stack icons (React, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, AWS)
- Code window mockup illustration

### Services
Service offerings display with:
- Two service cards side-by-side
- Custom Software Development
- Web & Mobile Apps
- Hover effects for polish

### Contact
Quote request form with:
- Name, email, message fields
- Form validation with inline errors
- Loading state during submission
- Success notification

## Design System

**Colors:**
- Primary: `blue` — Buttons, links, accents
- Secondary: `red` — Highlights, badges
- Neutral: `slate` — Backgrounds, text, borders

**Typography:**
- Heading/Body: Inter
- Monospace: JetBrains Mono

**Dark Mode:**
All components support light and dark mode via Tailwind's `dark:` variant.

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions about tech stack and form handling.
- **Add your own notes** — Customize prompts with project-specific context when needed.
- **Start with Foundation** — Get project setup right before adding sections.
- **Review thoroughly** — Check implementations carefully to ensure design fidelity.
- **Wire up form submission** — The Contact component needs backend integration.
